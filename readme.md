# Subtitle Timestamps

Subtitles were consistently slightly off on a movie I was watching, and existing solutions for offsetting the timestamps either required installing some application or had some other undesired quirk. I made this for myself, and after it worked, I decided to add a UI to my command line script and host it on gh-pages.
